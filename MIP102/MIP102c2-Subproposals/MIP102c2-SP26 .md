## Specification

This MIP102c2 Subproposal does not seek to amend Article 1 of a Scope Bounded Mutable Alignment Artifact. It is thus considered a General Edit. An MIP102c2 General Edit cannot modify Article 1 elements.

### Motivation

This subproposal will amend MIP106 Section 8, to include new Component (8.4): Ecosystem Actors Communication Requirements.

### Amended MIPs and Components

- MIP106 Section 8
  - 8.4: Ecosystem Act Communication Standards
    - 8.4.1: Open Channel Commitment
    - 8.4.2: Defined Response Time
      - 8.4.2.1: Initial Acknowledgement

One new subsection of Section 8 is modified by this amendment. If other MIP102c2 amendments are being voted upon in the same monthly cycle as MIP102c2-SP26, then MIP102c2-SP26 overwrites any other amendments passed concurrently for this subsection 8.4.
