## Specification

This MIP102c2 Subproposal does not seek to amend Article 1 of a Scope Bounded Mutable Alignment Artifact. It is thus considered a General Edit. An MIP102c2 General Edit cannot modify Article 1 elements.

### Motivation

This subproposal will amend MIP62 to reflect changes to the MakerDAO governance structure.

### Amended MIPs and Components

- MIP62

If other MIP102c2 amendments are being voted upon in the same monthly cycle as MIP102c2-SP22, then MIP102c2-SP22 overwrites any other amendments passed concurrently for MIP62.

### Amendment Pull Request

https://github.com/makerdao/mips/pull/1050

### Summary of Changes

- Relaxed the requirement for a posting in a specific section of the forum
- Changed references to Core Units to Ecosystem Actors or Facilitators, as relevant
- Added clarification that for the purposes of MIP62, an entity with multiple Scope Facilitator titles only counts as a single Facilitator
- Placed the Communications Coordinator role under the Accessibility Scope Facilitator, since that is whose mandate already covers user-facing UIs
- Clarified that to satisfy the first requirement for expedited offboardings, the statement should be in the text of the proposal to offboard
