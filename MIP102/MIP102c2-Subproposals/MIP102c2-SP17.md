## Specification

This MIP102c2 Subproposal seeks to amend Article 1 of a Scope Bounded Mutable Alignment Artifact. It is thus considered an Article 1 edit and cannot seek to amend any content except for Article 1.

### Motivation

I (@IamMeeoh) am posting this document on behalf of the KISS AVC as I am currently the KISS AVC moderator. 

During the course of Q3 (July+August+September 2023) the KISS AVC has held weekly meetings working towards its Q3 Position document which has been officially published [here](http://forum.makerdao.com/t/kiss-position-document-for-q3-09-21-2023/22147/2?u=iammeeoh), the 21st of September 2023. 

A _proper subset_ of the language contained in the KISS Q3 Position document, the passages having highest priority and likely wide support across all AVCs, have been used to produce this MIP102 Amendment proposal. It contains modifications to all 5 Scopes (MIP104, MIP106, MIP107, MIP108 and MIP113).

This work would have not been possible without the huge amount of work done by AD @vigilant, to whom the KISS AVC is very greateful. Many thanks also to all other ADs following KISS, in particular @Bonapublica and @Palc, who have contributed to this MIP102c2 subproposal.
