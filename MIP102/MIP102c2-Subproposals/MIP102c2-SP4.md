## Specification

### Motivation

This subproposal will amend MIP104 to better codify and standardize Arranger reporting requirements.

### Amended MIPs and Components

MIP104 Section 5

### Amendment Pull Request

<https://github.com/makerdao/mips/pull/954>

Two sections are modified by this amendment. If other MIP102c2 amendments are being voted upon in the same monthly cycle as MIP102c2-SP4, then MIP102c2-SP4 overwrites any other amendments passed concurrently for the two sections: 5.1.2., and 5.1.4.

### Summary of Changes

* Expanded 5.1.2 fees for stablecoins to cover any collateral expected to never realistically depreciate in value, such as US government securities and bank deposits.
* Provided explicit guidance in 5.1.4 about what information Arrangers should report, and two different pathways to be compliant.
