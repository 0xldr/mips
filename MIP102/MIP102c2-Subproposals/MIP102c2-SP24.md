## Specification

This MIP102c2 Subproposal does not seek to amend Article 1 of a Scope Bounded Mutable Alignment Artifact. It is thus considered a General Edit. A MIP102c2 General Edit cannot modify Article 1 elements.

### Motivation

This subproposal seeks to establish a procedure for interpretation and appeal processes in accordance with [articles 2 & 3 from MIP113](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP113#2-atlas-immutable-alignment-artifact). Consider [this ongoing discussion](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/participation-requirements-for-ads-that-follow-sovereign-finance-avc/21800) as the primary motivation for this proposal, given that the issues raised remain unresolved. It will also be a strong motivation the [MIP102c2-SP19: MIP Amendment Subproposal](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip102c2-sp19-mip-amendment-subproposal/22335) which had the support from Sovereign Finance AVC and Aligned Delegates but never moved to formal submission.
