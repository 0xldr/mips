## Specification

This MIP102c2 Subproposal does not seek to amend Article 1 of a Scope Bounded Mutable Alignment Artifact. It is thus considered a General Edit. An MIP102c2 General Edit cannot modify Article 1 elements.

### Motivation

This subproposal will amend MIP101 and MIP113 to provide clarifying edits to AVC meeting schedule requirements and introduce an AVC moderator role.

### Amended MIPs and Components

- MIP101 Section 2.5.5.1
- MIP113 Section 5.1.1

The above subsections are modified or created by this amendment. If other MIP102c2 amendments are being voted upon in the same monthly cycle as MIP102c2-SP25, then MIP102c2-SP25 overwrites any other amendments passed concurrently for the listed subsections.
