## Specification

### Motivation

I suggest introducing amendments to **Article 1** of the Alignment Artifacts primarily to provide additional details within the Advisory Council sections, which will facilitate the process of hiring new members. These proposed changes are in line with the AVC Aligned Scope Proposals and the valuable insights gained from our weekly discussions. The main emphasis will be on the MIPs that specifically address the Stability Scope and Accessibility Scope, as the previous MIP already addressed the other aspects. Furthermore, some minor edits are included for the Governance Scope, Support Scope, and Protocol Scope to ensure comprehensive improvements.
