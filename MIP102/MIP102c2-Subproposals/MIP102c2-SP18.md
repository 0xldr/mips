## Specification

This MIP102c2 Subproposal does not seek to amend Article 1 of a Scope Bounded Mutable Alignment Artifact. It is thus considered a General Edit. An MIP102c2 General Edit cannot modify Article 1 elements.

### Motivation

This subproposal will amend MIP104 to provide clarifying edits to [recently updated](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip102c2-sp4-mip-amendment-subproposals/20035) MIP104 5.1.2 and MIP104 5.1.4, and also to provide a process for onboarding and offboarding of Cash Stablecoins other than through direct MIP102c2 edits or the discretion of the Stability Scope Facilitator(s).

### Amended MIPs and Components

- MIP104, Section 5
- MIP104, Section 7

### Amendment Pull Request

---

Two subsections of Section 5 are modified by this amendment. If other MIP102c2 amendments are being voted upon in the same monthly cycle as MIP102c2-SP18, then MIP102c2-SP18 overwrites any other amendments passed concurrently for these subsections: 5.1.2 and 5.1.4.

Two subsections of Section 7 are modified by this amendment. If other MIP102c2 amendments are being voted upon in the same monthly cycle as MIP102c2-SP18, then MIP102c2-SP18 overwrites any other amendments passed concurrently for these subsections: 7.2.1.3 and 7.2.1.3.1A

### Summary of Changes

* Clarify the meaning of `stable asset` in 5.1.2
* Rephrasing of `standalone governance poll` vs previous `standalone vote`
* Fixed typos in 5.1.4.1
* Made the first sentence of 5.1.4.2 more closely match the first sentence of 5.1.4.3 in phrasing
* Clarified in Section 7.2.1.3 that conversion must be within 24 hours, rather than within 30 minutes, to avoid an existing Cash Stablecoin not meeting the definition.
* Clarified in Section 7.2.1.3.1A that `exposure to` cash stablecoins is the maximum debt ceiling (`line` parameter)
