## MIP109c2: Scope Framework Articles

### 1: The Physical Resilience Advisory Council

#### 1.1: The Physical Resilience Advisory Council definition
The Physical Resilience Advisory Council is a group of Physical Resilience Actors that have been approved by Maker Governance to carry out advisory work related to improving the content of the Physical Resilience Scope Framework.

#### 1.2: Physical Resilience Advisory Council membership management
Members of the Advisory Council are directly approved by Maker Governance through a governance poll, and must fulfill specific criteria.
##### 1.2.1: The Responsible Facilitators must ensure that potential Advisory Council Members can apply to be approved by Maker Governance, using an open process with clear instructions.
---
##### 1.2.2: Advisory Council Members must be Physical Resilience actors that are not involved in any business activity that could result in a conflict of interest, either directly or indirectly. They must also have relevant skills for providing professional expert input on the content that the Physical Resilience Scope is covering.
---
##### 1.2.3: The Responsible Facilitators must periodically, when it is relevant, review the Advisory Council Applications, and if they find applications that are suitable, bring them to a vote through an MKR governance poll. Approved Advisory Council Members are added to **10.2.3.1:**.
---
##### 1.2.4: The Responsible Facilitators may, if they deem it necessary, hold a vote to remove an Advisory Council Member. If an Advisory Council Member has not done any paid work for the Scope for at least 1 year, then the Responsible Facilitators can choose to remove them at will, if they deem it necessary.
---
##### 1.2.5: The current approved Advisory Council Members are recorded in the soft element **1.2.5.1**.

#### 1.3: Physical Resilience Advisory Council projects and funding
The Advisory Council is paid on a project basis to do specific work that improves all or specific parts of the Scope Framework.
##### 1.3.1: Each Quarter, if they deem it necessary, the Responsible Facilitators must solicit proposals and find one or more suitable Advisory Council Members to perform a project that will result in output that can be used to improve the Scope Framework. This work output will be presented to the CVC Subcommittee Meetings as the starting point for the CVC Scope Framework Position Documents. As many CVCs as possible should be supported this way, prioritized by the Responsible Facilitators.
---
##### 1.3.2: In case an ambiguous, uncertain or challenging situation arises related to the Scope Framework, the Responsible Facilitator may approach one or more Advisory Council Members to perform a reactive project that aims to specify the language of the Scope Framework to take into account the specific situation. The Responsible Facilitator can then directly propose the change to the Scope Framework in a weekly governance poll, quickly resolving the challenge.
---
##### 1.3.3: The Advisory Council may not produce work output that is directly compatible with the formatting of the Scope Framework. In this case the Responsible Facilitator must either transcribe it themselves, or hire an Ecosystem Actor to perform the transcription. This role does not require preapproval by Maker Governance.
---
##### 1.3.4: The Responsible Facilitators may also produce advisory input on the content of the Scope Framework themselves, as long as it is focused on improving process and governance content. They are prohibited from providing unilateral input on expert subject matter content.
---
##### 1.3.5: The Responsible Facilitators have a budget available to pay for Advisory Council Projects per quarter. All spending must be limited to only what is deemed necessary and with a high probability of producing clearly measurable value, and this must be transparently be accounted for in a forum post at least a week before any transaction occurs.
###### 1.3.5.1

---
##### 3.4.5: Claim Management.
Overview of the claim management processes:
* Legal Counsel Pre- approval
* Claim approval
* Reimbursement
###### 3.4.5.1 *Legal Counsel and quote Pre-approval*
The first step in the claim management process is to approve the Legal Counsel that will undertake legal defense or legal representation and the quote presented to commence legal work.
The Beneficiary must present the Quote from the law firm they selected for their legal defense / representation. The Quote must indicate, at least:
* Name of Legal Counsel
* Name of Law Firm
* If not in [Lawyer Registry], Proof of Eligibility
* The Quote must include:

1) The initial payment required by Counsel to commence work immediately. This is the initial amount to be claimed against the Resilience Fund.

2) A global estimated fee based on an hourly rate OR fix fee OR retainer

* **3.4.5.1.1:** If the Legal Counsel is LDF qualified in the Lawyer Registry (3.3.2 ), the claim is automatically pre approved.
* **3.4.5.1.2:** If Legal Counsel is NOT LDF qualified in the Lawyer Registry (3.3.2 ), then the Physical Resilience Facilitators verifies if the Legal Counsel complies with requisites in 3.3.1 (Lawyer Registry Acceptance Criteria) and 3.3.2  (Resilience Fund Acceptance Criteria). 
  * **3.4.5.1.2.1:** If the Legal Counsel of the quote is found to comply with the requirements, the quote is pre-approved and the legal counsel is added to the LR. 
  * **3.4.5.1.2.2:** If the Legal Counsel doesn’t comply with the LR requirements, the claim is rejected and the Beneficiary must propose a different Legal Counsel.
###### 3.4.5.2 *Claim Approval.*
If a Beneficiary incurs in a Loss Event, they can submit a Reimbursement Claim against the LDF by sending an encrypted message to a Physical Resilience Facilitator. The Physical Resilience Facilitator must review the Reimbursement Claim and decide whether to trigger a Governance Poll to perform a claims payout, by developing an internal model with input from experts and professionals.
* **3.4.5.2.1:** The Reimbursement Claim must contain following elements:
    * Description of Loss Event with relevant commentaries and context
    * Advance Payment
    * Type of process
    * Date of writ / subpoena / lawsuit
    * Supportive Documentation
      * Law firm’s proposal and invoice OR Quote
      * Copy of the Lawsuit / writ/ communication OR official requirement issued by a Court or Governmental Agency
Supportive documentation is highly sensible. It is required to use encryption tools.
 *  **3.4.5.2.2:** The Recognized Facilitator must develop a framework for establishing limits and coverage amounts per case, and apply these limits to individual claims.
###### 3.4.5.3 *Payment/reimbursement.*
If the governance poll for paying out a claim is successful, an executive vote must be created to to draw the funds from the Surplus buffer and send them to the Beneficiary's registered wallet. The spend must be accounted for in the active element of the relevant budget.

### 4: Legal research and preparedness
The Physical Resilience Facilitators must ensure that legal research and legal preparedness work is covered continuously to ensure the ecosystem is well positioned to deal with any legal uncertainty or risk that should arise. This must generally be broadly diversified across all jurisdictions where the Maker Ecosystem could be directly or indirectly exposed, but efforts and resources must be prioritized towards jurisdictions where risks are more likely to emerge.
#### 4.1: The Legal research and preparedness budget is described in *4.6.1.1A*. The Physical Resilience Facilitators can trigger a payout from the budget to a relevant recipient address through the weekly cycle.
####4.1.1A:
